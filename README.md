# Overview



This is a simple software designed for mantaining a single record using the Rust language.

The purpose of this software is to demonstrate the syntax and functionality of the Rust programming language.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
